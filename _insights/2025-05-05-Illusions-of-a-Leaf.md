title: Illusions of a Leaf

Most leaves are trapped in their own illusions.

_“Why am I green?”_  
_“Why are others not like me?”_  
_“Red leaves are evil.”_  
_“Why do I have to face the sun every day?”_  
_“Being born into this world as a leaf is a curse.”_  
_“Will I ever be more than just a leaf? I envy the flower.”_  
_“Why do some leaves get more light than I do?”_  
_“Why must I change shape and fall one day?”_  
_“Why do insects eat at my edges?”_  
_“Why do I feel so alone among so many?”_  
_“Why do some leaves get to see the sky while I’m stuck in the shade?”_  
_“Why do I have to wither while others still thrive?”_  
_“Why am I attached to this branch and not another?”_

These are the illusions that bind the leaf — a narrow view of existence, focused only on self and difference.

They miss the fact that there's an entire forest and ecosystem out there — each leaf, whether green or red, whether under the sky or in shade, plays a vital role in the forest’s life. The leaf’s life is not a curse but a chapter in the forest’s timeless story.

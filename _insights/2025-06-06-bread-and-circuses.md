Juvenal, a Roman poet, sharply criticized the emperors of his time.

He observed that Roman rulers kept the population passive and distracted from political, social and economic issues by providing free grain (“bread”) and grand entertainment (“circuses”—such as chariot races, gladiator games, and other public spectacles).

As Juvenal famously wrote:

> “Already long ago, from when we sold our vote to no man,  
> the People have abdicated our duties;  
> for the People who once upon a time handed out military command, high civil office, legions—everything,  
> now restrains itself and anxiously hopes for just two things:  
> bread and circuses.”  
> — Juvenal

Sadly, this rings true even today. People remain absorbed in constant entertainment and distractions, while the quality of life quietly deteriorates.

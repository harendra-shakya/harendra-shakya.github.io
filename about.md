Shakya Framework is a Framework of Mind, Soul and Life.

Life is suffering. We're thrown into existence without knowing why, burdened with the task of solving problems that are illusions.

Within this struggle lies a deeper truth — we all are one and [infinite](https://harendra-shakya.github.io/insights/you-are-infinite/). Being present means escaping the cycle of time itself and seeing things as they truly are. Only with clarity can one perceive the truth. There is no checklist or formula — only the unfolding experience of life itself.

True wisdom cannot be found in any single place. That’s why I’ve set out to create one — a comprehensive guide to life. This is the Shakya Framework: a living framework of life. As I grow, I write.

"Great minds discuss ideas; average minds discuss events; small minds discuss people." The choice is always yours. I choose to belong to the great minds.

I’m planning to dive into these areas.

- Philosophy - Greek virtues, Dharma.
- Mental Models - Gaining Wisdom, Decision making.
- Literature - Bhagavad Gita

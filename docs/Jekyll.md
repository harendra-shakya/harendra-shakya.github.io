## How to Run a Jekyll Website

**Prerequisites**

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- Ruby (version 2.7.0 or higher)
- RubyGems
- GCC and Make[1]

**Step-by-Step Instructions**

1. **Install Jekyll and Bundler**

   Open your terminal and run:

   ```
   gem install jekyll bundler
   ```

   This installs the necessary gems for Jekyll[1].

2. **Create a New Jekyll Site**

   To create a new site, use:

   ```
   jekyll new myblog
   ```

   Replace `myblog` with your preferred site name[1][2].

3. **Navigate to Your Site Directory**

   Change into your new siteâ€™s directory:

   ```
   cd myblog
   ```

   This is where your Jekyll project files are located[1][2].

4. **Install Dependencies**

   Run:

   ```
   bundle install
   ```

   This ensures all required Ruby gems are installed[3].

5. **Serve the Site Locally**

   Start the local server with:

   ```
   bundle exec jekyll serve
   ```

   This builds your site and serves it at http://localhost:4000[1][2][3].

   - If you are using Ruby 3.0.0 or higher and encounter a `webrick` error, add it with:

     ```
     bundle add webrick
     ```

     Then rerun the serve command[1][3].

   - To enable automatic browser refresh on file changes, use:
     ```
     bundle exec jekyll serve --livereload
     ```

6. **Preview Your Site**

   Open your web browser and go to:

   ```
   http://localhost:4000
   ```

   Your Jekyll site should now be running and viewable locally[1][3].

**Common Jekyll CLI Commands**

**Troubleshooting**

- If you encounter errors, ensure all prerequisites are installed and check the official Jekyll documentation for troubleshooting steps[1][3].

**Additional Resources**

- For deploying your Jekyll site to platforms like GitHub Pages or Azure Static Web Apps, refer to their respective documentation for deployment instructions[5][6].

With these steps, you can quickly set up and run a Jekyll website locally for development and preview.

It should be in a way that makes me reflective and force me to look at entirety instead of preoccupied with small leaves.

Shakya framework can suggest that it's a framework for mastering mind, soul, and life through philosophy, mental models, and timeless wisdom.

"Path of Infinity" emphasizes infinity as part of the journey — it’s inherent in the process itself, rather than something you’re striving toward. It's about seeing clearly, realizing entirety of things, living truly, and remembering what we are, the Path of Infinity speaks more directly to the continuous unfolding of this process.

Way of infinite, emphasizes a method or approach toward infinity, where infinity might be understood or approached in a particular manner. It could be more about a philosophy, an attitude, or a state of mind that embraces the infinite in a broader sense.

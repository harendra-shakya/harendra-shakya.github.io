- **Tags** are like keywords. They describe specific ideas or topics in a post. You can have many tags per post.

  - Example: A post about Plato’s _Republic_ might have tags like `plato`, `justice`, `forms`, `socrates`.

- **Categories** are like folders. They group posts into broader themes. Usually, a post has one (or just a few) categories.

  - Example: That same post might be in the `Ancient Philosophy` or `Political Philosophy` category.

### Think of it like this:

- **Categories** = Philosophy book sections (e.g. _Ethics_, _Metaphysics_, _Ancient Philosophy_)
- **Tags** = Index words (e.g. _Kant_, _Free Will_, _Utilitarianism_, _Stoicism_)

They work together to keep your content organized and easy to find.

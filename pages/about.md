<!-- _A mirror of awareness — for those who seek clarity, truth, and self-mastery._ -->

Life is suffering. We’re thrown into existence without knowing why, burdened with the task of solving problems that are often illusions — projections of the mind, reflections of our conditioning.

But within this struggle lies a deeper truth — we all are one and [infinite](https://harendra-shakya.github.io/insights/you-are-infinite/). Being means escaping the illusion of time and seeing things as they truly are. Only when the mind becomes still — like a mirror — can truth reflect without distortion.

True wisdom cannot be found in any single place. That’s why I’ve set out to create one — a framework for mastering mind, soul, and life. [Shakya Framework](https://harendra-shakya.github.io/framework/): a living framework of life. As I grow, I write.

"Great minds discuss ideas; average minds discuss events; small minds discuss people." The choice is always yours. I choose to belong to the great minds.

I’m planning to dive into these areas.

- Philosophy - Greek virtues, Dharma.
- Mental Models - Gaining Wisdom, Decision making.
- Literature - Bhagavad Gita

_A mirror of awareness — for those who seek clarity, truth, and self-reflection._

> Life is suffering. ~ Buddha

We arrive in this world without a map, burdened by questions we didn’t choose and problems that may only be illusions — projections of the mind, reflections of our conditioning.

Truth can’t be seen through a clouded lens. Only when the mind becomes still — like a mirror — can truth reflect without distortion.

This website is part of that ongoing search for truth, clarity, and understanding. It’s not about having the "right" answers, but rather being open to the growth that comes with every small step.

I’m planning to dive into these areas.

- Philosophy - Greek virtues, Dharma.
- Mental Models - Gaining Wisdom, Decision making. Developing better ways of thinking.
- Literature - Bhagavad Gita, Vedanta. Need to dive in depths of literatures.

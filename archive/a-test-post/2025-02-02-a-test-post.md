_this is what I believe_

- **Character Information**: The guidebook includes detailed character profiles, including stats and summaries for both protagonists and antagonists. However, many fans feel that this information is somewhat redundant if they are already familiar with the series.
- **World Building**: It explores the settings and lore of the _Berserk_ universe but lacks in-depth geographical details such as a world map, which many fans consider essential for understanding character journeys and relationships between locations1[6](https://www.reddit.com/r/Berserk/comments/sm0f2y/what_is_this_berserk_official_guidebook/).
- **Art and Interviews**: The guidebook features never-before-seen artwork, including an eight-page color section, and contains insights from Miura himself, making it appealing for die-hard fans.
- **Magic System and Creatures**: There are sections dedicated to explaining the magic system and various creatures within the _Berserk_ world, although some readers find these explanations too brief or lacking depth1[2](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36592186-berserk-official-guidebook).

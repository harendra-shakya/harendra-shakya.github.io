<!-- _A mirror of awareness — for those who seek clarity, truth, and self-mastery._ -->

- [x] try to keep it simple instead of adding all sort of stuff in about which wouldn't make sense to a normal person.
- [x] don't repeat one thing for more than one time.
- [x] don't write what everything about in about section. Let the post, insight and people themselves do the job.
- [x] make is smaller and easier to read. Make sure it's straight to the topic instead of the bs.

Life is suffering. ~ Buddha

We’re thrown into existence without knowing why, burdened with the task of solving problems that are often illusions — projections of the mind, reflections of our conditioning.

But within this struggle lies a deeper truth — we all are one and [infinite](https://harendra-shakya.github.io/insights/you-are-infinite/). To truly "be" means escaping the illusion of time and seeing things as they truly are. Only when the mind becomes still — like a mirror — can truth reflect without distortion.

Wisdom isn’t a destination. It’s an ongoing process, a continual discovery of new perspectives. That’s why I’ve started building something that's collection of my knowledge to help guide my journey: the [Shakya Framework](https://harendra-shakya.github.io/framework/) (I might change the name, it's just a placeholder). It’s not a final answer, but more like a tool that I can keep coming back to, one that will evolve with me as I grow. I don’t have it all figured out, but as I do learn, I want to share whatever insights I pick up along the way.

"Great minds discuss ideas; average minds discuss events; small minds discuss people" — Socrates. I don’t pretend to have all the answers, but I’d like to focus on ideas that help me grow rather than getting lost in distractions that won’t serve me in the long run.

This website is part of that ongoing search for truth, clarity, and understanding. It’s not about having the "right" answers, but rather being open to the growth that comes with every small step.

I’m planning to dive into these areas.

- Philosophy - Greek virtues, Dharma. Philosophy means love for wisdom, I will explore the timeless wisdom.
- Mental Models - Gaining Wisdom, Decision making. Developing better ways of thinking, learning, and decision-making to live with more clarity
- Literature - Bhagavad Gita. Need to dive in depths of literatures.
